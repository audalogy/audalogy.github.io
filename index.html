                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">I'm Cantonese Singaporean, born and raised in California, and I'm driven by understanding human behavior in all contexts order to create persuasive technologies that improve the well-being of others. In a previous career, I audited billion dollar hedge funds, helped restructure a food and beverage company fraught with financial misstatements, enforced anti-corruption in Beijing, and investigated fraud in Bogotá as a public and forensic accountant. I have an appreciation of teamwork, business strategy, quantitative analysis, bottom-line results, and sensitively asking hard questions. With an undergraduate degree in psychology along with my current projects in product design, data visualization, and front-end development at UC Berkeley, I combine  business skills with a deep understanding of users and the abilily to iterate quickly through prototypes and designs.

                        <p2> Small businesses are the backbone of U.S. economy – over 50% of the population works for SMB and 500k SMBs are started each month, and the statistics are similar in other countries. Yet, SMBs face unique challenges on their path to success, on how to succeed in a new market, or compete against much larger incumbents. Hack together a working prototype of an application or mobile application that will help small business owners.

                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2> We interviewed local business owners around the UC Berkeley campus and asked them what their pain points were and how their businesses could be improved. A common complaint we heard was that business owners often had wasted excess inventory at the end of the day or they would have downtime with no customers. For example, one cupcake shop owner said that sometimes she had so many cupcakes left over that she couldn't find enough homeless people to give them away to. We wanted to help SMBs such as food shops and hair salons.</p2>

                        <h7>THE OUTCOME <br> </h7>
                        <p2>Our team created a mobile application that would allow small business owners to spontaneously offer discounts on their excess inventory from services to perishable goods. The app offered spontaneous, on-demand discounts within a 10 minute proximity to the consumer, linking him/her to the excess inventory. <br> <br> </p2>                        
                    </div>

                        <p2>Using Justinmind, I started out by prototyping an auction model for the business users. In the auction model, small businesses owners would be able to choose a timeslot for which to bid on in order to advertise their deals. After the owner chooses a timeslot, the app would show the number of customers that the a certain bid would buy him/her. After choosing the reach of customers, the small business owner can then put a bid on the timeslot. I tested out this design by showing it to one of the mentors at the hackathon. After showing this prototype to our mentor and seeing him struggle to comprehend the business model, I realized this workflow would be too complicated for a SMB to quickly grasp and use. This prompted our team to change our design to be a much more simplified purchasing model for each timeslot. <br> <br> </p2> 
                   

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/Pronto/pronto_assets_resize.jpg" alt="Pronto Screenshots"><br>

                    
                        <p2>Using the Sketch app, I and a teammate subsequently redesigned the business-facing interface to have a much simpler purchasing model. In this UI, business owners would first see a timeslot that has expired, prompting a reactionary desire to purchase the next timeslot. The next timeslot shows a time to expiration and remaining coupons (or 'prontos'), creating the sense of urgency and spontaneity. The business owners can only purchase for the next two hours, which focuses them on an immediate purchase, and reduces additional contemplation or analysis. After he/she has chosen a timeslot, the screen then prompts them to adjust how many 'prontos' to send out to consumers with the app. The price of these deals is displayed as a round number to reduce complexity. <br> <br> </p2> 

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/Pronto/pronto_consumer.png" alt="Pronto Screenshots"><br>

                        <p2>We designed Pronto such that users who downloaded the app would only receive one offer, called a “Pronto”, every hour, on the hour for a place within 20 minutes walking distance. Once they received the offer, they had only 60 minutes to redeem the offer. We wanted to build both anticipation as well as the fear of missing out for each offer. <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2> Improve aging at home using Samsung SmartThings (internet of things) sensors<br><br></p2>

                        <p2> First, our team met with our client, Samsung, to understand their goal, problem statement, resources, and constraints. Following that meeting, we created a customer/user needs assessment plan to target seniors with the desire to live independently but who also have caregivers.  We accessed the seniors through relatives, locations were seniors gathered, independent living facilities, senior living advisors, and the NextDoor social networking platform. We conducted user needs through face-to-face interviews as well as observations of their living facilities. We gathered information concerning a typical day in their life, social habits, attitudes and experience with technology, and health concerns. <br><br> </p2>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/brio/environment_resize.png" alt="Observation"><br>

                        <p2>We interviewed a total of 15 seniors in independent living facilities (users) and 5 caregivers (customers). From the interviews, we gained insights through affinity diagramming and created a business proposition canvas and a customer/user needs analysis. Based on the needs analysis, we each generated 10 of our own concepts and then met together in a team brainstorming session where we generated 50 more concepts for a total of 100 concepts.  In order to narrow down to the final idea, we created a concept selection matrix of eight of the top criteria that were applied in the selection of the top 6 product concepts to present and discuss with Samsung.  <br><br> </p2>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/brio/process_resize.png" alt="Process"><br>

                        <p2>From those, we selected three concepts to create “proof-of-concept” sketches to get feedback from our target users and customers – a smart trashcan, a smart handbag, and a smart pillbox. From the concept testing feedback, we selected the smart pillbox to create a working prototype due to its highest potential to improve the independence and social connection of seniors as well as a high room for innovation in the design. <br><br>
                        </p2>

                        <h7>KEY LEARNINGS <br> </h7>
                        <p2>Just as the customer or user might not know what he/she wants, the client may not know what they want either. Thus, it was important to get feedback on ideas early and often so the client can better understand what they want through seeing the ideas presented. Our client, Samsung, posed key constraints as well as resources that were important for us to be aware of.<br><br>

                        Concept testing also can be useful in the generative phase of the design process to get more ideas of potential features and user needs. We could have prompted the conversation with an existing product or rough sketches to start the brainstorming and creative process.<br><br>

                        It was important to reference the customer needs analysis so as not to stray away from those needs during concept generation. Good selection criteria helps picking concepts that both met customer needs and were feasible. Daily common items from a water cup to a fridge - every design has its pros and cons and can be redesigned to be "smart".<br><br>

                        Although we ultimately converged on a product idea, an auto-dispensing smart pillbox, there were still many more cycles of iteration to go through. We needed to converge on the target customer/user first before brainstorming product ideas, and it would have been beneficial to converge on the product idea earlier on to be able to iterate even more times. There could be many different ways to go about designing the mobile phone interface of a smart pillbox as well as the physical hardware design. <br><br>

                        <p2> Our final deliverables included a working 3D-printed prototype of the smart pillbox using Samsung SmartThings weight sensors and Arduino, an interactive prototype of the smartphone application for the caregivers, a triple bottom line analysis, the business financial model, and a final tradeshow presentation. We presented our project to the research team at Samsung, and it was very positively received.

                        <p2> This was a team project for the course, Design and Development of Web-Based Products. My 4-member team and I aimed to design a mobile application to help people estimate the wait times in lines prior to arrival. We learned design methods such as interviews, affinity diagramming, concept generation, personas, paper prototyping, and high-fidelity prototyping. The outcome of this project will be a functional mobile prototype.

                        <p2> The initial mission for this project was to provide the approximate wait-time in line before someone arrives to a busy public place so that people can make data-driven decisions about what to do with their time.</p2>

                        <p2>After setting up our initial mission, we created a <a href="img/portfolio/freepass/interview_guide.pdf" target="_blank"> consolidated interview guide </a> to test our assumptions about the mission. Our guide contained eight questions about the last time someone was waiting in a line, their needs before and during the wait in line, their behaviors during the wait, and their willingness to pay for wait time information. Our target users included busy working professionals or busy students, whom we hypothesized spent the most time waiting in line for restaurants.

                        One of our assumptions was that there would be users who consumed information about lines and users who reported line information. We assumed that the people reporting line information would check-in when they arrived at the crowded location and update the information when they reached the end of the line. A large constraint was that without enough users, the data quality may be poor, and we needed to figure out how to get users to accurately report line length in a low-friction way. <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>With the results of the interviews, we created an affinity diagram to parse out themes in user needs from the eight interviews we conducted. We discovered four main themes in user needs: information about the line, distractions from the line, checking in or complaining about the line, and reducing the time standing in line.   <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>After conducting user interviews and re-evaluating user needs, we discovered that one service people would be willing to pay for would be reducing the time in line. We also learned that lack of self-reported data may result in inaccurate estimation of wait times, which would greatly reduce the credibility of the product. Thus, we changed the mission to reducing wasted time by reinventing the way the world waits. The product would open up more free time for diners and more business for the local community by seamlessly connecting diners to entrepreneurs. The target market changed to being busy working professionals in their 20’s or 30’s who want to dine out at popular restaurants with no available reservations.<br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>Next, we generated three different concepts that addressed the same use case of the new mission: a busy professional wanting to eat at a popular restaurant with a group of friends and hiring another person to wait on behalf of him while he runs some other errands at home. Two of the concepts used the swim-lane process model for accomplishing the same use case. The third concept focused on new process flows based upon a different information architecture. We also leveraged benchmark products and services for possible organization and navigation schemes. <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>A team member and I created a paper prototype to illustrate a concept for how the prototype user (persona) would use this product to accomplish the use case of just-in-time booking of a person to wait in line for him/her.  We conducted “think aloud” user evaluations with this prototype and the other prototype designed by another member of the team.

                        After reviewing the results of the paper prototype evaluations, we reached a consensus on the approach for our next design. Using the feedback, we created an interactive prototype using Justinmind.<br><br></p2>

                        <p2>We learned that the length of the sign-up process significantly decreases the conversion rate for every additional screen. The app may have requested personal information too early before the customer built trust in the product. An additional confirmation page after inputting the payment information would have provided additional comfort that the booking was actually made. Some users had questions about who the queuer was and whether they could browse by queuer, so we could have made it more prominent that you are automatically matched to a queuer based on the restaurant chosen. The mobile application should also continue the user journey by showing the user's distance from the restaurant and the interface interaction after the user arrives at the restaurant and claims the booking. <br><br>

                        In terms of interface design improvements, we learned the importance of a uniform style guide.For example, action buttons should have a particular style of color, font, or size that differentiates from status and from plain text information. Certain font colors, such as blue, often indicate links and should be reserved for that purpose. We should also choose icons carefully to ensure they clearly signal particular real world objects or metaphors, so the user can easily anticipate the consequences of clicking an icon.

                        <p2> Create a new mapping experience involving information organization and retrieval principles. We aimed to create a maps mashup that would allow users to annotate maps to tell a story.

                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2> The process began with a wireframe prototype using Balsamiq. and a plan for the technologies we would use based on the information stored and displayed in the map. We also created an Entity-Relationship diagram the flow and architecture of information. <br><br></p2>

                        <p2>A running maps mashup website on which Leaflet maps were annotated and images stored in a MongoDB database. </p2> <br><br><br>

                        <p2>Above is the Entity-Relationship Diagram that I initially created to organize the relational database. Each moment is related to the map, the event, related people, and other attachments such as images or document files. The intended design of this database schema was to make it extensible by making it easier to incorporate any future changes and by trying to compartmentalize many of the changes so that it would be easier to make changes to the application in the future. We moved from using SQLite to MongoDB since we were doing a lot of front end handling of JSON data. For this reason it made sense to use MongoDB which uses a similar key-value pair syntax that would enable better interoperability between the backend and the frontend. During this process, we had to modify our data model a little bit to account for the shift from using a relational database.</p2> <br><br>

                        <p2>This was the homepage of the running maps mashup website on which Leaflet maps were annotated and images stored in a MongoDB database. The homepage shows two different maps that one could potentially view. The images for each of the maps are customizable and are subsequently stored and retrieved from the database. Additionally, the information about the creator, date created, and tags are also stored in the database.</p2> <br><br>

                        <p2> After clicking “continue” the user can begin to navigate the events of the mapped experience. A set of circular icons on the right side of the page shows the user how many events are in the mapped experience.  </p2> <br><br>

                        <p2> A user can move through the events in the mapped experience using the forward button, scrolling down (or up), or by selecting a circle icon from the right edge of the page. The play button will reveal the next marker after 10 seconds. Using the icons allows the user to move immediately to any other event within the mapped experience. Additionally, the user is able to interact with each event map without affecting the other maps on the page. </p2> <br><br>

                        <h7>THE GOALS <br> </h7>
                        <p2>The primary goal of the project was to help future researchers or students understand
                        what data was contained in the restaurant menu archive, to help them have a better
                        grasp of the distribution and scope of the information prior to them undertaking efforts
                        to identify trends or correlations across different variables contained in the data set. To
                        achieve this, we set out to create a website that shows the user how we analyzed,
                        clustered, and wrangled the hand-transcribed menu data. <br><br>
                        The secondary goal after laying out the data was to clean noisy data (incorrectly
                        transcribed, non-US related, etc.), organize the remaining information into clusters and
                        look into what we can possibly visualize in the selected data for the top 25 curated dish
                        categories from the data set.</p2>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class= "col-xs-12 push3">
                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2>In conducting research for this project, we first looked at existing attempts to
                        communicate food consumption related to socio-economic factors and/or food trends
                        over time. We then looked various ways to visualize the data that was provided in the
                        archive such as force-directed tree graphs, co-occurrence matrices, and tree maps. 
                        We also explored the menu dataset using Tableau to explore and manipulate data around prices, frequency, and menu location. <br><br>

                        In the data cleaning and wrangling process, we clustered similarly named dishes and normalized their frequencies. Although the majority of dishes only appeared once, some dishes were stated several different ways and could have been grouped and identified as the same dish. To account for this, we created a "fingerprint" for each item, plus how many and which items fell under each fingerprint. Using these fingerprints, we formed 25 “mega clusters” to further group together similar items and 7 categories to group together the “mega clusters.”We also normalized the frequency of dishes according to the number of menus in record for that year.</p2><br><br>

                        menu item location, number of dishes in the dataset, price fluctuations, and location of
                        the menus in the US.</p2> <br><br>

                         <p2> In our final visualization, we chose appropriate graphic forms and principles for visualizing the data. In coding the layout and interactions, we used a bootstrap template to structure the webpage and tell the story of the archive. While we were coding one of the data visualizations, we encountered an obstacle and had to shift our course as a result. Finally, we evaluated the visualization with three users who were interested in menu archives to walk through our visualization and evaluated how well they understood what the visualizations represented and whether it provided new insights or takeaways. </p2> <br><br>

                        <h7>RESULTS AND EVALUATION <br> </h7>
                        <p2>We went through several rounds of user testing with researchers throughout the
                        development process to clarify our visualization strategy and our overall narrative in
                        Menu Journeys. <br><br>
                   
                        One researcher had access to early iterations of the force-directed graph and called it
                        quite confusing, to say the least, which was apparent to everyone else on our team as
                        well. She suggested exploring alternative methods to visualize co-occurrence, such as a
                        matrix, which also ultimately proved to be too challenging to implement under the
                        constraints of our dataset and the deadline at hand. <br><br>

                        Another researcher suggested a multi-pronged approach to our design -- using many
                        visualizations woven together to tell a story -- which is the direction our team ultimately
                        took. She cautioned against the use of an all-encompassing dashboard tool and instead
                        wanted to be guided toward inspiring insights. <br><br>

                        Perhaps the most valuable user-testing session was with a former researcher for the
                        federal Food and Drug Administration. He particularly liked the feature in our cluster tree
                        map that allowed him to directly search the NYPL menu archive based on dish names via
                        hyperlink, which we implemented following feedback from our professor. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/menuJourneys/06treemap.jpg" alt="Treemap"><br>

                        <p2> He also appreciated the narrative structure of Menu Journeys. He said he liked scrolling from visualization to visualization and being told a story by each one. The supplemental text and story tiles from Tableau made it possible to guide the discussion. “These write-ups by the visualizations really highlight and guide the analysis. It’s like something you would see in a museum,” he said, by pointing out things “beyond the obvious.” </p2> <br>

                        <h7>THE CHALLENGE <br> </h7>
                        <p2>People on a budget often cannot find affordable stays in increasingly expensive and crowded cities. We wanted to find out if there was an interest in hotel sharing as a solution and if so, what business model was preferred. <br><br>The challenge was to develop five distinct landing pages that highlight different product pricing options for different ways to share a hotel room. Our goal was to secure at least 1,000 visitors for the landing pages through social media and advertising and at least 500 email addresses from potential customers on the landing page.</p2>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class= "col-xs-12 push3">
                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2> We hypothesized five pricing models for a hotel sharing website. Four were business to consumer models and one was business to business. We used <a href="http://www.unbounce.com" target="_blank"> unbounce.com</a> to test the landing pages, which were identical except for the advertised pricing. <br><br>
                        The landing page design was created through unbounced.com using the Modern Minimalist Design in white. The color scheme of gold and silver that I chose was to evoke a higher class, elegant feel. This is not meant to be for shady hooking up with random strangers or anything like Bang with Friends. Therefore, I avoided hot pink, black, or other neon colors that may conjure an idea of a one night stand. This is a professional, polished looking website and service that has a trusted reputation. One perspective is an "upgrade" to your room by using this site and splitting with someone else. Therefore, I used the colors of gold and silver to represent a higher class feel that is almost an elite status. I also showed the potential of achieving VIP reward status to evoke an impression of prestige, status, and elitism. This is not a website that one should be ashamed to visit. On the contrary, one should be proud to be a part of this program, as it demonstrates that one has high standards when it comes to traveling and one only stays in the best hotel rooms with other people that have also been accepted and approved in the process. This should be a badge of honor that our customers are proud to tell their friends and family about. <br><br>

                        In order to get the word out about these two websites, I employed multiple strategies. The first strategy was to post the website link for the B2C pricing model in Facebook groups, Google+ communities, and forums related to hobbyist conventions and music festivals. The second strategy was to search through housing wanted posts on Craigslist in expensive, major cities. The third strategy was to find Facebook groups and LinkedIn Groups related to startups, entrepreneurs, Founders, the Berkeley alumni network, the Berkeley startup network, or Silicon Valley startup entrepreneurs and ask them to support my startup. The final strategy was to create surveys through <a href="http://aytm.com/" target="_blank"> AYTM</a>, which directs surveys toward a specified target market.</p2>

                        <h7>THE OUTCOME <br> </h7>
                        <p2>Within one week, we received over 1,090 visitors and obtained 479 email addresses from potential customers, which satisfied our goal. The pricing model strategy that received the highest conversion rate at 47.73% was charging a 10% fee for each shared hotel booking. Surprisingly, visitors to the site were more comfortable paying for a value-add product rather than receiving the service for free. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/A.png" alt="SuiteSplitA"> <br>
                        <p2>The first variant pricing model was free to share for anyone. SuiteSplit would make money through affiliate revenue and ad revenue. We advertised trusted roommates on the site, indicating identity verification for everyone who signs up. With VIP Rewards, the more people use SuiteSplit, the more that they save. Customers can accumulate reward points through using our service that would allow them to get more discounts on future bookings. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/B.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2>The second variant pricing model kept everything constant from the first pricing model, except we would charge a 10% fee to book through our service. The customer would still save at least 45% on their booking by sharing the room. The only difference was the way that we charged customers, specifically to see whether they would prefer to pay a 10% commission or share for free. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/C.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2> The third pricing model variation required customers to pay a flat fee per night of $15. They could save more money the pricier the hotel they booked. This would encourage customers to book more expensive hotels and to split with more people. We would also be targeting people who are going to more expensive cities such as New York or San Francisco as they would be able to save more money on hotels in those places. This landing page also advertised meeting new people instead of the trusted roommates, which tested whether people would want to meet new people (that could potentially be untrustworthy), while only paying a flat fee for each booking. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/D.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2> The fourth pricing variation was targeted towards people who want to make money, or perhaps profit from company reimbursements. We got this idea from one of the mentors during the mentor idea review who imagined many people going to corporate events and making additional money if they were already getting reimbursed by their company for the full price of the hotel room. Therefore, this landing page charged a higher fee of 15%, but they still make money. The landing page returns to the trusted roommate version with verified identities, so the only change is the fee of 15% instead of 10%. There were still VIP rewards advertised, so the more you use SuiteSplit, the more you save. This presents an opportunity for customers to stay loyal to our program, just like loyalty hotel programs. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/E.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2> The last pricing model variation was quite different than the others in that it was a business to business strategy. This was a platform that would perform in the background of the websites of the conventions or events as a white label. That way, the convention organizers could customize the service to the design of their own website, which event organizers had expressed that they wanted. The purpose of this landing page was to make organizing hotel sharing more efficient and also to optimize the use of hotel group rates.</p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/pricing_conversion.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2> The pricing model strategy that performed the best was the second variation, charging a 10% fee for each shared hotel booking.This variation received the highest conversion rate at 47.73%. From the testing results, it seemed that visitors feel more comfortable paying for a product that adds value rather than receiving the service for free. They may also be skeptical with receiving a service for free when the service has a cost to create. Therefore, charging a 10% fee is better than offering the hotel sharing and booking service for free. <br><br> With regards to the B2B revenue model, I would hesitate to use these results as there were only 12 visitors to the site. I would try to get at least 50 visitors before drawing any conclusions about the conversion rate for the B2B pricing strategy.</p2> <br><br>

                        <p2> Our initial hypothesis was that excellent "Chinese UX” will be driven by different principles and therefore allow for new types of UIs to emerge. The ultimate goal of this project was to understand what those new types of UIs and their standards would be.

                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br><br> </h7> 
                        <p2> Part 1: Research, identify and define ‘UI standards’ and UX design philosophy for US sites/apps versus Chinese sites/apps. Explain the appeal and usability these standards hold for their market and note key areas of divergence between US and Chinese standards. <br><br>

                        Part 2: Identify trends and underlying causes/explanations behind each set of standards. This can include historical approaches to design and art, text input usability/optimization, key cultural influences, and overall market trends, which are favored by users. In the past, much of the world’s UI has been largely driven (defacto) from Western, particularly US standards and trends; however China, which has been largely isolated from western sites, has recently moved from ‘haphazard copying’ to ‘thoughtful design’ in a way that does not mirror US trends. Their homegrown UX designers have created interfaces that have enhanced usability and appealed to the specific needs of their users, even though these designs defy Western traditional standards of ‘excellent UX’. <br><br>

                        Our team researched a combination of the following in order to understand the underlying UX trends in China: <br>
                            •   Social-Cultural customs <br>
                            •   Art/Design history <br>
                            •   Business Practices <br>
                            •   Political Philosophy/Customs <br>
                            •   Modern Visual Design <br>
                            •   Cognitive Science/Psychology <br>
                            •   Economics & International Relations <br><br>

                        Part 3: Propose a vision for the future of Chinese UX <br><br>

                        For the final analysis, I compared the user experience and user interfaces of Uber and KauiDi / DiDi DaChe (China’s version of the on-demand taxi). <br><br>

                        <p2> Apply the lean startup methodology to find product-market fit of an early stage startup, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/180eats-san-rafael-2" target="_blank">180Eats</a>, delivering simple, healthy weeknight meals for suburban families and commuters. We received mentorship by <a href="http://steveblank.com/" target="_blank">Steve Blank</a>, author of The Four Steps to the Epiphany and The Startup Owner’s Manual. 
                        </p2>

                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2> 180Eats started with a minimum viable product delivering weeknight meals to individuals and families in Marin County. The startup had already been delivering 200 meals per week to customers to test the market, and we had an initial set of early adopters to research and test with. <br><br>

                        From there, we engaged in customer discovery through qualitative and quantitative user research to better understand their needs. We conducted over 100 interviews of customers, industry experts, potential partners, and competitors and designed a SurveyMonkey survey to assess customer retention and satisfaction.<br><br>

                        We used the Business Model Canvas to understand our value propositions, and highlight our biggest assumptions. One differentiator from other competitors like Munchery was that last-minute customers who also wanted healthy meal options could order up to 4pm on the same day. However, this proved to be a weak differentiator as Munchery was able to offer a similar “feature” soon after. Thus, we needed a better solution to cater to this last-minute group of customers.<br><br>

                        Another business model assumption was that the unit economics (customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value) made the company viable. We tested this assumption by deploying a SurveyMonkey survey to current customers assessing their needs and overall satisfaction. We received a total of 178 responses and analyzed retention of current customers by cohort. Inactive customers were satisfied less than 60% of the time with portions, nutritional content, presentation, and quality and taste of the meals. First-time customers were satisfied only 50% of the time with packaging, portions, nutritional content, and presentation. From this, we learned that customers did not perceive our initial value propositions as we expected. <br><br>

                        We ran small experiments to test different business models such as: <br>
                            •   Channels: Corporate distribution to companies with large offices in the Bay Area (grab-n-go), food truck, and micro-retail location at the Larkspur Ferry Station (large commuter hub) <br>
                            •   Delivery: removal of order cutoff window <br>
                            •   Revenue: Subscription model with loyal customers <br>

                        <p2>We learned to test our assumptions quickly and cheaply. In week 7, we pivoted the startup to focus priorities on testing corporate and on-the-go distribution channels rather than the delivery to consumer channel due to our research findings that the delivery channel had low margins and was becoming an increasingly saturated market. Corporations, on the other hand, had a clear need for freshly prepared meals – not only for dinner, but also breakfast and lunch. By week 10, we had implemented a test for the corporate grab-n-go model by installing a smart fridge at a Bay Area tech company. <br><br>

                        Being an effective startup founder is about starting and validating a product vision or key assumptions and not necessarily listening to all advisors or even users. Ultimately, the founding team needs to combine their intuition, research findings, and knowledge of the business to provide direction to the startup. </p2>

                        <p2> Currently, smartphones are able to detect signs of depression with statistical significance through monitoring behaviors such as social interaction, mobility, phone usage patterns, and sleep duration. However, these applications suffer from low adherence and engagement rates.<br><br>

                        We believe that seamless data collection combined with an interface that is less obtrusive to the user will increase application usage and improve overall mental health. Our project aims to leverage current research on computational algorithms used to detect and assess mental well-being, by building an application on a wearable device to passively collect biometric user data, evaluate risk for depressive mood, and introduce subtle micro-interventions through a wearable interface.

                        <p2> This is an interdisciplinary project, combining user research, hardware sensor data mining and machine learning, user experience design, and software development. <br><br>

                        Industry Landscape Analysis and Secondary Research <br>
                        We performed research on the background of various mental health disorders, phases and types of depression, and the competitive landscape. We also researched prior research and publications on the topic of mood analysis and mental health interventions through mobile or wearable devices. Through our research, we identified five indicators of depression detectable through wearable sensors: social interaction, mobility, sleep patterns, phone usage, and nocturnal temperature. Through interviewing several psychologists and medical experts, we found that depression was often comorbid with sleep, which is currently readily trackable through current wearable devices. Therefore, we decided to focus on initially addressing this concern in order to increase overall happiness and emotional well-being. <br><br>

                        Diary Study on Sleep <br>
                        In order to understand the needs of graduate students and their sleep habits, we did a two-week study of six people from ages 20-29.  For the study, we conducted an onboarding survey at the beginning of the study, an exit survey at the end of the study, a morning survey, and a night survey. The morning and night surveys were to be completed once each over five days. The morning survey asked questions about the timing of their sleep and the quality of sleep. The night survey contained more open-ended questions with reflections on their day such as social interactions, eating habits, and activities as well as descriptions of their activity and environment leading up to bedtime. The week after the diary study, we conducted post-interviews to delve further into interesting comments occurrences that came up in the surveys. We then compiled and analyzed common themes from the surveys and interviews. <br><br>

                        Data Collection and Machine Learning <br>
                        We created a mobile application to collect self-reported mood and activity scores using the experience sampling method (ESM) as well as linked Fitbit data to a local server. Then, we recruited 16 participants to track and report their Fitbit data as well as complete our surveys over a two-week period. From this data collection, we will be developing and training an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) recurrent neural network using Keras and TensorFlow as the backend to predict mood from activity data collected by Fitbit. Inputs to our algorithm are a set of data collected by Fitbit, mood scores self-reported by participants, and questionnaires of depression before and after a two-week recording period. Our goal is to use this algorithm to inform the timing of the sleep and mood interventions. <br><br>

                        UI/UX Design <br>
                        We conducted design sprint to brainstorm several different concept designs for the interventions in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia as well as positive psychology on Android Wear and mobile devices. <br>
