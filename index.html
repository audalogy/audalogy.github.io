                        <h7>THE CHALLENGE <br> </h7>
                        <p2> Small businesses are the backbone of U.S. economy – over 50% of the population works for SMB and 500k SMBs are started each month, and the statistics are similar in other countries. Yet, SMBs face unique challenges on their path to success, on how to succeed in a new market, or compete against much larger incumbents. Hack together a working prototype of an application or mobile application that will help small business owners.
                        </p2>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class= "col-xs-12 push3">
                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2> We interviewed local business owners around the UC Berkeley campus and asked them what their pain points were and how their businesses could be improved. A common complaint we heard was that business owners often had wasted excess inventory at the end of the day or they would have downtime with no customers. For example, one cupcake shop owner said that sometimes she had so many cupcakes left over that she couldn't find enough homeless people to give them away to. We wanted to help SMBs such as food shops and hair salons.</p2>

                        <h7>THE OUTCOME <br> </h7>
                        <p2>Our team created a mobile application that would allow small business owners to spontaneously offer discounts on their excess inventory from services to perishable goods. The app offered spontaneous, on-demand discounts within a 10 minute proximity to the consumer, linking him/her to the excess inventory. <br> <br> </p2>                        
                    </div>

                        <p2>Using Justinmind, I started out by prototyping an auction model for the business users. In the auction model, small businesses owners would be able to choose a timeslot for which to bid on in order to advertise their deals. After the owner chooses a timeslot, the app would show the number of customers that the a certain bid would buy him/her. After choosing the reach of customers, the small business owner can then put a bid on the timeslot. I tested out this design by showing it to one of the mentors at the hackathon. After showing this prototype to our mentor and seeing him struggle to comprehend the business model, I realized this workflow would be too complicated for a SMB to quickly grasp and use. This prompted our team to change our design to be a much more simplified purchasing model for each timeslot. <br> <br> </p2> 
                   

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/Pronto/pronto_assets_resize.jpg" alt="Pronto Screenshots"><br>

                    
                        <p2>Using the Sketch app, I and a teammate subsequently redesigned the business-facing interface to have a much simpler purchasing model. In this UI, business owners would first see a timeslot that has expired, prompting a reactionary desire to purchase the next timeslot. The next timeslot shows a time to expiration and remaining coupons (or 'prontos'), creating the sense of urgency and spontaneity. The business owners can only purchase for the next two hours, which focuses them on an immediate purchase, and reduces additional contemplation or analysis. After he/she has chosen a timeslot, the screen then prompts them to adjust how many 'prontos' to send out to consumers with the app. The price of these deals is displayed as a round number to reduce complexity. <br> <br> </p2> 

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/Pronto/pronto_consumer.png" alt="Pronto Screenshots"><br>

                        <p2>We designed Pronto such that users who downloaded the app would only receive one offer, called a “Pronto”, every hour, on the hour for a place within 20 minutes walking distance. Once they received the offer, they had only 60 minutes to redeem the offer. We wanted to build both anticipation as well as the fear of missing out for each offer. <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2> This was a team project for the course, Design and Development of Web-Based Products. My 4-member team and I aimed to design a mobile application to help people estimate the wait times in lines prior to arrival. We learned design methods such as interviews, affinity diagramming, concept generation, personas, paper prototyping, and high-fidelity prototyping. The outcome of this project will be a functional mobile prototype.

                        <p2> The initial mission for this project was to provide the approximate wait-time in line before someone arrives to a busy public place so that people can make data-driven decisions about what to do with their time.</p2>

                        <p2>After setting up our initial mission, we created a <a href="img/portfolio/freepass/interview_guide.pdf" target="_blank"> consolidated interview guide </a> to test our assumptions about the mission. Our guide contained eight questions about the last time someone was waiting in a line, their needs before and during the wait in line, their behaviors during the wait, and their willingness to pay for wait time information. Our target users included busy working professionals or busy students, whom we hypothesized spent the most time waiting in line for restaurants.

                        One of our assumptions was that there would be users who consumed information about lines and users who reported line information. We assumed that the people reporting line information would check-in when they arrived at the crowded location and update the information when they reached the end of the line. A large constraint was that without enough users, the data quality may be poor, and we needed to figure out how to get users to accurately report line length in a low-friction way. <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>With the results of the interviews, we created an affinity diagram to parse out themes in user needs from the eight interviews we conducted. We discovered four main themes in user needs: information about the line, distractions from the line, checking in or complaining about the line, and reducing the time standing in line.   <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>After conducting user interviews and re-evaluating user needs, we discovered that one service people would be willing to pay for would be reducing the time in line. We also learned that lack of self-reported data may result in inaccurate estimation of wait times, which would greatly reduce the credibility of the product. Thus, we changed the mission to reducing wasted time by reinventing the way the world waits. The product would open up more free time for diners and more business for the local community by seamlessly connecting diners to entrepreneurs. The target market changed to being busy working professionals in their 20’s or 30’s who want to dine out at popular restaurants with no available reservations.<br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>Next, we generated three different concepts that addressed the same use case of the new mission: a busy professional wanting to eat at a popular restaurant with a group of friends and hiring another person to wait on behalf of him while he runs some other errands at home. Two of the concepts used the swim-lane process model for accomplishing the same use case. The third concept focused on new process flows based upon a different information architecture. We also leveraged benchmark products and services for possible organization and navigation schemes. <br> <br> </p2>

                        <p2>A team member and I created a paper prototype to illustrate a concept for how the prototype user (persona) would use this product to accomplish the use case of just-in-time booking of a person to wait in line for him/her.  We conducted “think aloud” user evaluations with this prototype and the other prototype designed by another member of the team.

                        After reviewing the results of the paper prototype evaluations, we reached a consensus on the approach for our next design. The next step will be to make an interactive prototype using Justinmind.<br> <br> </p2>

                        <h7>ABSTRACT <br> </h7>
                        <p2> Our project goal is to create a “Internet of Seats and Spaces” product where people can easily find seats and spaces and start “talking” to them to reserve the seat or space. The initial focus will be on seats, in particular those within the UC Berkeley campus, but this could be expanded to public transport, cafes, bathrooms etc.<br><br>

                        The usefulness of the product is mainly in that people will be able to easily find and book seats where they can work, study, relax, etc. The project idea was born from personal experience and annoyance about having to walk around the UC Berkeley campus libraries or nearby cafés to find an available seat to study. During peak times like midterms or finals, this task can be particularly difficult. Our project would eliminate instances where you walk to a building only to find out all the seats are taken – you could easily lookup the free areas beforehand on your phone or laptop and decide where to go based on that. In certain occasions we could even allow students to book the actual seat ahead of time.<br><br>

                        For the prototype, we will use an Arduino microcontroller with a load sensor and wifi capabilities that would communicate with a web server and let it know if the state changes (taken/free). The server will process this data and communicate the status of the seats to students through a smartphone app.<br><br>

                        The biggest challenge would be making a real-life product out of this as this would require significantly cheaper sensors, power consumption considerations, handling scale and user adoption both from seat/space owners and users. Also we must be careful not to clash with existing customs and behavior. For example, in some scenarios, people might ignore the seats’ reservation status and use them anyway, which would make the booking feature problematic. </p2>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class= "col-xs-12 push3">
                        <h7>SOURCES <br> </h7>
                        <p2> The sources can be any objects that usually represent a space. This can be chairs, couches, tables, rooms, etc. Our primary focus will begin with chairs, in particular the kind found in classrooms. Currently, these chairs do not come with any technology built in, so the actual source will be a small device that discreetly attaches to the chairs. <br><br>

                        The prototype will sense the state of the chair occupancy by sensing weight on the chair. A simple way to do this could be to use a force sensitive resistor. Weight on the chair will be interpreted as the chair being currently occupied. No weight will be interpreted as the chair being currently free. <br><br>

                        Occupancy state changes will be communicated to the server (transformer) in real-time. We will attempt to do this using a Arduino-compatible WiFi module first, though there may be issues with connecting to Airbears. If that is the case, we will explore other alternatives for achieving connectivity. <br><br>

                        The following verbs will be supported by this source: <br>
                            •   checkin: The chair becomes taken.<br>
                            •   leave: The chair becomes free.<br><br>
                        
                        These two verbs most naturally deal with spaces and places, and fit well with the indication of occupancy state changes. The actor will be a person, though in many cases the person will be unknown or anonymous. The object will be the chair itself, with an identifiable ID. </p2>

                        <h7>TRANSFORMERS <br> </h7>
                        <p2>There is only one type of transformer for now, which is essentially a web server. The transformer takes input data from different sources, processes the data, stores their state, and then outputs the composed data to consumers. The first task of the transformer is to get the status of all chairs, combine that information with its seat reservation schedule, and then send the composed data to consumers. The second task is to receive requests from consumers, check the status of specific seats in the seat reservation schedule table and inform consumers whether their requests were approved or not. The approval process may involve administrators of the seat reservation system.<br><br>

                        The transformer’s input data consists of the current status of the chairs from sources and chair reservation requests from consumers. The output data consists of current and future statuses of the chairs within a specific time frame as well as the status of seat reservation requests. In addition to the data above, the transformer also stores seat reservation schedule with the seat status and the person who requests or reserves the seat.<br><br>

                        The input data from the smartphone app (consumer) in AS format:<br>
                            •   request: A user requests a seat reservation <br>
                            •   cancel: A user cancels a seat reservation request <br>
                            •   approve: administrators approve the seat reservation request <br>
                            •   deny: administrators deny the seat reservation request <br><br>

                        The output data in AS format: <br>
                            •   collection: one of the object type. It’s used to show the seat reservation schedule in array format. <br>
                            •   startTime: start time of one spot on the seat reservation schedule table <br>
                            •   endTime: end time of one spot on the seat reservation schedule table <br>
                            •   status: status of the seat. The values are taken and freed. <br>
                            •   result: result of seat reservation. The values are free, requested or reserved. <br>
                            •   alert: one of the object type. It’s used to send notifications to consumers. </p2>

                        <p2> Primary Consumer: Smartphone App <br>
                        The primary consumer will be a smartphone app for students to use to find and reserve open seats. The app will consume the data from the server about the status of various seats and display this information to the user. It will also allow the user to request or cancel a seat reservation, communicating this data to the transformer, which would then update the state of the seat, and push that information back to consumers. <br> <br>

                        Secondary Consumer: Chair Device (Source) <br>
                        The chair device will also consume information from the server/transformer about its reservation status and reflect that information to the world via a text screen or light indication. 

                        See the input/output data description of the transformer for more details on what consumer data can involve. </p2>

                        <p2> Create a new mapping experience involving information organization and retrieval principles. We aimed to create a maps mashup that would allow users to annotate maps to tell a story.
                        </p2>

                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2> The process began with a wireframe prototype using Balsamiq. and a plan for the technologies we would use based on the information stored and displayed in the map. We also created an Entity-Relationship diagram the flow and architecture of information.  </p2>

                        <h7>THE OUTCOME <br> </h7>
                        <p2>A running maps mashup website on which Leaflet maps were annotated and images stored in a MongoDB database. </p2> <br><br><br>
                    </div>

                        <p2>Above is the Entity-Relationship Diagram that I initially created to organize the relational database. Each moment is related to the map, the event, related people, and other attachments such as images or document files. The intended design of this database schema was to make it extensible by making it easier to incorporate any future changes and by trying to compartmentalize many of the changes so that it would be easier to make changes to the application in the future. We moved from using SQLite to MongoDB since we were doing a lot of front end handling of JSON data. For this reason it made sense to use MongoDB which uses a similar key-value pair syntax that would enable better interoperability between the backend and the frontend. During this process, we had to modify our data model a little bit to account for the shift from using a relational database.</p2> <br><br>

                        <p2>This was the homepage of the running maps mashup website on which Leaflet maps were annotated and images stored in a MongoDB database. The homepage shows two different maps that one could potentially view. The images for each of the maps are customizable and are subsequently stored and retrieved from the database. Additionally, the information about the creator, date created, and tags are also stored in the database.</p2> <br><br>
            
                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/Mapster/mapster01.png" alt="Mapster01"> <br>

                        <p2> After clicking “continue” the user can begin to navigate the events of the mapped experience. A set of circular icons on the right side of the page shows the user how many events are in the mapped experience.  </p2> <br><br>
        
                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/Mapster/mapster02.png" alt="Mapster02"> <br>

                        <p2> A user can move through the events in the mapped experience using the forward button, scrolling down (or up), or by selecting a circle icon from the right edge of the page. The play button will reveal the next marker after 10 seconds. Using the icons allows the user to move immediately to any other event within the mapped experience. Additionally, the user is able to interact with each event map without affecting the other maps on the page. </p2> <br><br>

                        <p2>The user can hover over an image in the event description to see a larger version of the image. </p2> <br><br>

                        <p2> How might we design an experience to engage and motivate millennials to improve one or more of their vital signs to financial health? </p2>

                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2>First, we sought to understand what financial health meant for millenials. We used the persona of “Felipe” as a guide. Felipe is a Junior in college who is currently learning to pay his bills on time. His parents are his main source of income, and he will be transition to a full-time career when he graduates. <br><br>
                        We then mapped out Feilpe’s journey from college to graduation to becoming a working professional. We wanted an app that would help him develop good habits as he transitioned through these life stages. For Felipe, financial health was defined as being able to pay bills on time to build a strong credit score, avoid overdrafts, save for unexpected expenses, and ultimately become financially independent from his parents.

                        <h7>THE OUTCOME <br> </h7>
                        <p2>My teammates and I designed a financial fitness coach, called #Finfit, to coach financial newbies on healthy savings and investment practices.</p2> <br><br>
                    </div>

                        <p2>First, we started ideating as many ideas as possible for helping millenials become more financially fit. Then, we were provided with the persona of Felipe to model our solution for. We also decided to focus on the financial values of spending wisely and protecting. We wanted to help Felipe develop consistent habits that would stay with him. We converged on an idea for FinFit, which was a financial coach for millenials, analogous to a FitBit.</p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/FinFit/felipe_persona_resize.png" alt="Persona"><br>

                        <p2>We were provided with the persona of Felipe in order to better understand the needs and motivations of the target millenial user. We learned that Felipe was struggling to manage unexpected expenses and relied on his parents for an allowance. He needed to plan for graduation, but he did not know what to expect. We took these needs into account as we designed our solution. </p2> <br><br>

                        <p2>Using persona of Felipe, we mapped out the customer journey using the app. We wanted the app to transition him through the path of college, graduation, and having a full-time job. His ultimate goal was financial independence from his parents.</p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/FinFit/04features_resize.jpg" alt="Features"><br><br>

                        <p2>We came up with several key features that went along with the themes of financial education, personalization, and social support. </p2> <br><br>

                        <h7>THE CHALLENGE <br> </h7>
                        <p2>People on a budget often cannot find affordable stays in increasingly expensive and crowded cities. We wanted to find out if there was an interest in hotel sharing as a solution and if so, what business model was preferred. <br><br>The challenge was to develop five distinct landing pages that highlight different product pricing options for different ways to share a hotel room. Our goal was to secure at least 1,000 visitors for the landing pages through social media and advertising and at least 500 email addresses from potential customers on the landing page.</p2>

                        <h7>THE PROCESS <br> </h7>
                        <p2> We hypothesized five pricing models for a hotel sharing website. Four were business to consumer models and one was business to business. We used <a href="http://www.unbounce.com" target="_blank"> unbounce.com</a> to test the landing pages, which were identical except for the advertised pricing. <br><br>
                        The landing page design was created through unbounced.com using the Modern Minimalist Design in white. The color scheme of gold and silver that I chose was to evoke a higher class, elegant feel. This is not meant to be for shady hooking up with random strangers or anything like Bang with Friends. Therefore, I avoided hot pink, black, or other neon colors that may conjure an idea of a one night stand. This is a professional, polished looking website and service that has a trusted reputation. One perspective is an "upgrade" to your room by using this site and splitting with someone else. Therefore, I used the colors of gold and silver to represent a higher class feel that is almost an elite status. I also showed the potential of achieving VIP reward status to evoke an impression of prestige, status, and elitism. This is not a website that one should be ashamed to visit. On the contrary, one should be proud to be a part of this program, as it demonstrates that one has high standards when it comes to traveling and one only stays in the best hotel rooms with other people that have also been accepted and approved in the process. This should be a badge of honor that our customers are proud to tell their friends and family about. <br><br>

                        In order to get the word out about these two websites, I employed multiple strategies. The first strategy was to post the website link for the B2C pricing model in Facebook groups, Google+ communities, and forums related to hobbyist conventions and music festivals. The second strategy was to search through housing wanted posts on Craigslist in expensive, major cities. The third strategy was to find Facebook groups and LinkedIn Groups related to startups, entrepreneurs, Founders, the Berkeley alumni network, the Berkeley startup network, or Silicon Valley startup entrepreneurs and ask them to support my startup. The final strategy was to create surveys through <a href="http://aytm.com/" target="_blank"> AYTM</a>, which directs surveys toward a specified target market.</p2>

                        <h7>THE OUTCOME <br> </h7>
                        <p2>Within one week, we received over 1,090 visitors and obtained 479 email addresses from potential customers, which satisfied our goal. The pricing model strategy that received the highest conversion rate at 47.73% was charging a 10% fee for each shared hotel booking. Surprisingly, visitors to the site were more comfortable paying for a value-add product rather than receiving the service for free. </p2> <br><br>

                        <p2>The first variant pricing model was free to share for anyone. SuiteSplit would make money through affiliate revenue and ad revenue. We advertised trusted roommates on the site, indicating identity verification for everyone who signs up. With VIP Rewards, the more people use SuiteSplit, the more that they save. Customers can accumulate reward points through using our service that would allow them to get more discounts on future bookings. </p2> <br><br>

                        <p2>The second variant pricing model kept everything constant from the first pricing model, except we would charge a 10% fee to book through our service. The customer would still save at least 45% on their booking by sharing the room. The only difference was the way that we charged customers, specifically to see whether they would prefer to pay a 10% commission or share for free. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/C.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2> The third pricing model variation required customers to pay a flat fee per night of $15. They could save more money the pricier the hotel they booked. This would encourage customers to book more expensive hotels and to split with more people. We would also be targeting people who are going to more expensive cities such as New York or San Francisco as they would be able to save more money on hotels in those places. This landing page also advertised meeting new people instead of the trusted roommates, which tested whether people would want to meet new people (that could potentially be untrustworthy), while only paying a flat fee for each booking. </p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/D.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2> The fourth pricing variation was targeted towards people who want to make money, or perhaps profit from company reimbursements. We got this idea from one of the mentors during the mentor idea review who imagined many people going to corporate events and making additional money if they were already getting reimbursed by their company for the full price of the hotel room. Therefore, this landing page charged a higher fee of 15%, but they still make money. The landing page returns to the trusted roommate version with verified identities, so the only change is the fee of 15% instead of 10%. There were still VIP rewards advertised, so the more you use SuiteSplit, the more you save. This presents an opportunity for customers to stay loyal to our program, just like loyalty hotel programs. </p2> <br><br>

                        <p2> The last pricing model variation was quite different than the others in that it was a business to business strategy. This was a platform that would perform in the background of the websites of the conventions or events as a white label. That way, the convention organizers could customize the service to the design of their own website, which event organizers had expressed that they wanted. The purpose of this landing page was to make organizing hotel sharing more efficient and also to optimize the use of hotel group rates.</p2> <br><br>

                        <br><img id="inner_banner" src="img/portfolio/suitesplit/pricing_conversion.png" alt="SuiteSplitB"> <br>

                        <p2> The pricing model strategy that performed the best was the second variation, charging a 10% fee for each shared hotel booking.This variation received the highest conversion rate at 47.73%. From the testing results, it seemed that visitors feel more comfortable paying for a product that adds value rather than receiving the service for free. They may also be skeptical with receiving a service for free when the service has a cost to create. Therefore, charging a 10% fee is better than offering the hotel sharing and booking service for free. <br><br> With regards to the B2B revenue model, I would hesitate to use these results as there were only 12 visitors to the site. I would try to get at least 50 visitors before drawing any conclusions about the conversion rate for the B2B pricing strategy.</p2> <br><br>
