                    <br>
                    <p>Having worked in four different countries (U.S., China, Mexico, and most recently Singapore), I've worn many different hats including co-founder, user experience researcher, product manager, product designer, and data visualization developer. In May 2016, I completed my Master's at UC Berkeley School of Information focusing on human-computer interaction, qualitative/quantitative UX research, technology innovation, and behavioral economics. </p>
                    <p>I combine business strategy with a deep understanding of users and the ability to iterate quickly through prototypes and designs. Technology is a medium through which I seek to understand human behavior and interactions to inform product designs that address latent or core user needs that improve lifestyle or well-being.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not iterating to create better products and user experiences, I can be found scuba diving, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xyqnCAQsARyayfkl0dSNKg" target="_blank">eating at restaurants</a>, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5780263-audrey" target="_blank">reading</a>, <a href="https://projectsgolfleague.wordpress.com/2016/02/09/2015-bart-classic-the-villages-gc/" target="_blank">golfing</a>, experimenting with <a href = "https://aunaturalista.wordpress.com" target="_blank">skincare</a>, or learning something new. </p>

                    <br>

                    <strong>WHY SINGAPORE?</strong>
                    <p>Being Cantonese-Singaporean, born and raised in Silicon Valley, and having spent my education and career in the Bay Area, it has been my life-long dream to work abroad in Asia. After graduation, I had the rare opportunity to work as a Product Manager at <a href="https://www.visenze.com/" target="_blank">an artificial intelligence image recognition startup</a>, and I couldn't pass it up. During the past year and a half in Singapore, I traveled to nine different countries, became an advanced scuba diver and <a href="https://vimeo.com/217430122" target="_blank"> dove in the Maldives</a>, volunteered at a <a href="https://www.imh.com.sg/page.aspx?id=463" target="_blank">mental health institute</a>, won grand prize at a hackathon, and <a href="http://www.woodenfish.org/hbmlp2017" target=_"blank">studied Buddhism / meditation in a Chinese monastery</a>. I've recently relocated back to the Bay Area, and I'm excited to collaborate with a passionate team working to solve meaningful problems.</p>

                    <br>

                    <strong>WHY HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION?<strong>
                    <p> I majored in Psychology as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, and although I wasn't sure how to turn that major into a career at the time, I was hoping to eventually incorporate it into my work. In 2013, I took an online human-computer interaction course through Coursera, and I realized this was the ideal way for me to apply psychology in my work. I went to graduate school to study HCI more intensively as well as explore interests in entrepreneurship, innovation, and data science, and throughout my various positions in data visualization, product management, and product design, I've realized that UX research frames the problem and the solution, and mixed-methods research is what I'm most passionate about focusing on full-time. </p>
